      "title": "What Are Types?",
      "content": "In programming, a 'type' describes what kind of data a variable can hold. Think of types as labels that tell you (and TypeScript) what you can do with a piece of data. For example, you can add numbers together, but you can't add a number to a piece of text. Types help prevent these kinds of mistakes.",
      "analogy": "Imagine types as containers in your kitchen: a water bottle holds liquids, a jar holds solids, and a freezer bag holds frozen items. You wouldn't put soup in a freezer bag or freeze water in a jar without consequences. Similarly, TypeScript types ensure data goes in the right 'container'.",
      "example": "// Without types (JavaScript)\nlet age = 25;\nage = 'twenty-five'; // This works but is confusing!\n\n// With types (TypeScript)\nlet age: number = 25;\nage = 'twenty-five'; // Error! Can't assign string to number"
    },

      "title": "The String Type",
      "content": "Strings represent text - any sequence of characters. This could be a name, a sentence, a paragraph, or even an empty string. In TypeScript, we use the 'string' type to indicate that a variable should hold text data.",
      "explanation": "Think of strings as anything you might write in a text message or type in a word processor. They're surrounded by quotes (single, double, or backticks).",
